Using pipelines behaviors in MediatR to solve cross cutting concerns 

# About the demo 

MediatR is a great library and pattern for creating a loosly coupling application logic and presentaion.
Every "command" and "response" between the different parts of our system will go through central mediater. 
As a very cool side effect MediatR allows use to create pipeline behaviours that can allow us to create a aspect oriented programming style; cross cutting concenrs like logging is handled by the framework.
